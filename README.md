##### Created by: Ghina Mubin, Meesha Hussain, Rahma Kamel, Tracy Huynh

This shiny application uses the FBI's data of hate crimes committed from 1991 to 2014. The data covers several different types of crimes committed against minority groups documenting year, and count. Our application will analyze hate crimes through time focusing on, religion, development of history, and major events. Our interactive map allows the user to view hate crimes all over the United States filtering it by bias motivation and year. We also analyzed how specific events in history impacted the trend of hate crimes against specific minority groups. Lastly, we analyzed hate crimes against differing religious groups over time and how the count fluctuates based on major historical events.
